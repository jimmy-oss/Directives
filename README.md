# DIRECTIVES

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Attribute directives manipulate the DOM by changing its behaviour and appearance. I have used this attribute directives to apply conditional styles to elements, show or hide elements, and, dynamically change the behaviour of an element based on a changing property, say, make a form field blink red if a user tries to submit the form without filling in that specific form field.
Structural directives, on the other hand, have been used to create and/or destroy DOM elements. This type of directives actually add or completely remove elements from the DOM unlike some attribute directives like hidden which maintain the DOM as it is.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
